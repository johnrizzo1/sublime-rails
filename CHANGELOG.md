# SublimeRails Changelog:

## 0.0.1

The goal of this release is to create a framework for continued development of ruby/rails related assets for SublimeText with gem and bundler as the first pieces to be included.

This is my first time writing a sublime text plugin so please give me a lot of feedback for improvement.  I took a great deal of inspiration from the Package Control plugin so thank you Will Bond for the work you did on such an awesome package.  Any problems you see with this package are definitely not the result of Wills work but rather my failing to follow his example ;).
