# Sublime Rails

Sublime Text 2 [http://www.sublimetext.com/2] plugin to support the development of ruby and rails applications.  This is an incredibly early release and has just enough functionality to help do what I want.  I intend to support all of the standard rails development workflow where there isn't already a good plugin available.

# Installation

Right now you'll have to clone this git repo into the sublime text plugins directory.  After I get it to support enough of what I want I'll see about adding this to the venerable Package Control library for easier installation.

# Commands

Right now I'm assigning two keystroke commands as indicated below.

## Bundler
* bundle list: super+alt+b, l
* bundle install: super+alt+b, i
* bundle update: super+alt+b, u
* bundle exec: super+alt+b, e

I'm working on much more so check the issues/enhancments for more.

# Gratitude

This project was inspired by the work of many other people including;
* The awesome Sublime Text package
* Nahuel Sciaratta and Bruno Bonamin's sublime-gem-browser package
* Will Bond's Package Control
